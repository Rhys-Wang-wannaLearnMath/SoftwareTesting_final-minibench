            "context": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained popularity in recent years as a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. EVs run on rechargeable batteries instead of gasoline and produce zero direct emissions. While they have many advantages, including lower operating costs and reduced environmental impact, they also face challenges such as limited driving range and longer recharging times compared to refueling conventional vehicles. The development of better batteries and charging infrastructure is ongoing to address these limitations.",

It is home to thousands of species of marine life, including fish, mollusks, and various types of coral. The reef plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems and also supports tourism and fishing industries. However, in recent decades, the reef has faced significant threats from climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Rising ocean temperatures have led to coral bleaching events, where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white and potentially die.",
